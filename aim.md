To understand the mathematical and biophysical aspects of voltage clamp experiment as a basic experiment in a neurophysiology laboratory. 

To study the contribution of Na+ and K+ currents as major contribution to the total current  generated by a nerve cell.

To understand how the parameters recorded from a voltage clamp experiment were used to formulate the kinetics of voltage activated ion channels responsible for excitation (Na+, K+, fast gates, slow gates, etc.)
